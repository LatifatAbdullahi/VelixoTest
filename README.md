### Descisions made and Why

- I decided to use Page actions to allow clean, reusable and maintainable scripts.
- I decided to seperate my locators into a .json file to allow easy reusability and maintainability
- I decided to seperate the Login flow to present repetition for every test and allow a clean script.
- I decided to use a .env file to store my email and password used to run the tests to present exposure of secret info.
